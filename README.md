## Make your own cardboard model planisphere

This repository contains Python scripts that can be used to produce a cardboard cut-and-glue kit to make your own model planisphere.

### Introduction

A planisphere is a simple hand-held device which shows a map of which stars are visible in the night sky at any particular time. By rotating a wheel, it shows how stars move across the sky through the night, and how different constellations are visible at different times of year.

See <https://in-the-sky.org/planisphere/index.php> for more information, including detailed assembly instructions.

### Getting started

To make planisphere models for all latitudes, at five degree intervals, run the shell script `main_planisphere.sh`.
Bibek note: Changed few bits of default settings so it can render the planisphere at 2 degrees seperation
Not really noticiable of small angles but can be useful if you want the precise point of your location

### Caveat
Planispheres do not work well when used close to the equator. The scripts in this repository do not allow you to create planispheres for latitudes between 15&deg;N and 15&deg;S, as the celestial pole is too close to the horizon.
